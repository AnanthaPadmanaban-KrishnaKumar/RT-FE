## Loss Function

### Custom Loss Function for Enhanced Learning

To extract rail line features using a U-Net with VGG19 as the backbone, we implement a custom loss function that significantly enhances the model's learning from the complex data distribution in rail scenes.

#### Weighted Binary Crossentropy

Our custom loss function begins with weighted binary crossentropy, addressing the class imbalance issue common in rail image segmentation. The weight parameters `w0` and `w1` are assigned to the background and rail line classes, respectively, to focus the model's learning on the minority class, which is critical for the detection task.

#### Focal Loss

The focal loss component reshapes the loss function to prioritize challenging, misclassified examples. It introduces hyperparameters `alpha` and `gamma` to control the contribution of each example to the loss, enabling the model to focus on difficult cases crucial for accurate feature extraction.
