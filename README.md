Our project harnesses the RailSem19 dataset, renowned for its extensive coverage of rail and tram environments. This dataset's rich variety in weather, lighting, and geographic scenarios serves as the foundation for training and fine-tuning our anomaly detection algorithms, ensuring their robustness and precision in real-world settings.

**Dataset Details:**
- **Source**: Available at [wilddash.cc](https://wilddash.cc)
- **Composition**: Over 1,000 video sequences uploaded by rail enthusiasts.
- **Variety**: Features 8,500 sequences showcasing a broad spectrum of environmental conditions and geographic locations.
- **Annotations**: Includes novel rail-specific labels, geometric shapes, and pixel-wise semantic labels. These are crafted through a blend of manual and weakly supervised annotations, derived from existing networks in the road domain.
- **Utility**: The dataset is instrumental for semantic scene understanding specific to the rail environment, presenting unparalleled opportunities for research in computer vision.

**Usage in Our Project:**
The JSON files accompanying the RailSem19 dataset images provide detailed rail line annotations. These annotations have been pivotal in generating mask files for the rail tracks in each image through a custom mask generator script.

### Mask Generation
Utilizing the annotations from the RailSem19 dataset, our mask generator script creates precise mask files that are essential for training our deep learning models. This script ensures that our models are attuned to the specific contours and characteristics of rail tracks, which is vital for the accurate detection of anomalies.

## Deep Learning Models
we used 2 models in this project.
We apply semantic segmentation to the complex task of rail anomaly detection using a U-Net architecture with a VGG backbone, chosen for its precision in pixel-wise identification.

### 1. U-Net Architecture with VGG Backbone

- **VGG Backbone**: 
  - Acts as the encoder in our U-Net architecture.
  - Uses deep convolutional layers known for capturing complex image patterns.
  - Includes ReLU activation functions and max-pooling to hierarchically process image features from simple to complex.

- **Convolutional Layers (Conv) + ReLU**: 
  - Serve as the primary feature extractors.
  - ReLU introduces non-linearity, allowing for the capture of complex patterns.

- **Max Pooling**: 
  - Reduces spatial dimensions to focus on prominent features.
  - Aids in the model's robustness to input variations and distortions.

- **Upsampling**: 
  - Increases the spatial resolution during the decoding phase.
  - Essential for translating learned features back to the original image scale.

- **Copy and Concatenate**: 
  - Merges features from the downsampling path with upsampled content.
  - Provides contextual information critical for accurate localization.

- **Convolutional Layers (Conv) + Batch Normalization**: 
  - Stabilizes learning by normalizing the input layers.
  - Refines feature maps post-concatenation, preparing for the final segmentation output.

The U-Net's architecture is particularly adept at maintaining high-resolution details through the upsampling process and merging low-level and high-level feature information. This results in a segmentation map that precisely differentiates rail lines from their surroundings, which is pivotal given the RailSem19 dataset's complexity.

Through this methodology, our model effectively captures the intricate details required for accurate rail line segmentation, even in the diverse conditions presented by the RailSem19 dataset images.

## 2. Autoencoder for Anomaly Detection

We use an autoencoder architecture to pinpoint anomalies on rail tracks, which is adept at identifying deviations from the norm within the rail line images.

### Fig 4. Autoencoder Architecture for Anomaly Detection
(Insert diagram of the autoencoder architecture here)

- **Input Layer**: 
  - Begins with a multi-channel input image of rail line patches, for example, 16x16x3 in dimensions.
  - The input layer feeds the image into the autoencoder.

- **Convolutional Layer (Conv2D)**: 
  - Applies filters (e.g., 64 filters of size 3x3) to detect local features like edges and textures within the rail line images.

- **Flatten Layer**: 
  - Converts the multi-dimensional output of the Conv2D layer into a one-dimensional array for processing in dense layers.

- **Dense Layers (Latent Space)**: 
  - Processes the features into a series of fully connected layers, reducing the data dimensionality and encoding it into a compact latent space.

- **Reshape Layer**: 
  - Transforms the data from the latent space back into a multi-dimensional array to prepare for the decoding process.

- **Conv2D Transpose Layer**: 
  - Acts as the inverse of the Conv2D layer, upsampling the data from the latent space back to its original image dimensions.

- **Output Layer (Reconstructed Image Iâ€™)**: 
  - Produces a reconstructed version of the input image, aiming to closely match the original in the absence of anomalies.

- **Anomaly Detection**: 
  - Relies on the comparison between the input image (I) and the reconstructed image (I').
  - Utilizes the reconstruction error to detect anomalies, with higher errors indicating potential anomalies.

The training of the autoencoder focuses on normal rail line images, enabling the model to reconstruct these effectively. When faced with anomalies, the reconstruction error spikes, which our system uses as a signal to flag potential issues. By setting a threshold for this error, we can reliably identify and alert to anomalies in the rail lines.
