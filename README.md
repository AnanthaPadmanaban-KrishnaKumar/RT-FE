## Introduction
This project leverages cutting-edge deep learning techniques to detect and categorize anomalies on rail tracks. By integrating binary semantic segmentation and self-supervised learning, our system is uniquely capable of identifying potential hazards without extensive manual labeling of training data.

## Project Description

### Stage 1: Isolation of Rails via Binary Semantic Segmentation
The first stage is focused on the isolation of rails from the surrounding environment. This is achieved through binary semantic segmentation, which sets the stage for the detailed analysis that follows.

### Stage 2: Anomaly Detection with Self-Supervised Autoencoders
The second stage utilizes self-supervised learning with autoencoders to detect anomalies, such as obstructions or damage to the rails. This stage is crucial for identifying irregularities like coal, dirt, and unexpected obstacles on the tracks.

## Key Contributions

- **Advanced Anomaly Detection**: The system identifies rail track anomalies with high precision, ensuring that no false positives or negatives affect the operational efficiency.
- **Reduced Need for Labeled Data**: Our methodology negates the necessity for a vast corpus of labeled anomaly data, which is typically challenging to procure.
- **Technological Progression**: This project draws upon the rich history of semantic segmentation, employing advanced frameworks like U-Net and FRRN to improve the segmentation process significantly.
- **Environmental Robustness**: The autoencoders are designed to adapt to varying environmental conditions, making the system versatile and reliable.

## Background and Motivation
The approach detailed in the paper "Anomaly Detection on the Rail Lines Using Semantic Segmentation and Self-supervised Learning" has shown success in real-world applications, highlighting the efficacy of the method. This project builds upon the technological advancements in semantic segmentation, utilizing the RailSem19 dataset to push the boundaries further in the railway sector.
